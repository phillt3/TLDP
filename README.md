Welcome to Too Long ; Didn't Play! This application is meant to help those of you like me, a gamer out of his prime and with a full time job, 
to find your next gaming experience without commiting to days of playing just to get the full experience. This application was a passion project
to hone some of my software development skills and solve this problem of mine. In the process of creating TL;DP I used the help of the RAWG API to create my 
own tailored database of video games and their properties, I created my own API endpoint following OPEN API specifications, I implemented JUnit Testing,
and I had a lot of fun. If you want to check out just the backend of the application or the python classes I used to create the database, check out
my TLDP-Database and TLDP-Core repositories. I will also be adding my first video to my youtube channel in the form of a presentation of the making of this
project which will be linked to my LinkedIn project section for TL;DP.
