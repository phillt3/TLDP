# Too Long ; Didn't Play

Welcome to **Too Long ; Didn't Play**! This application is meant to help those, like me, who are gamers with a full-time job, to find their next gaming experience without committing days to get the full experience. This application was a passion project aimed at honing some of my software development skills while solving this problem. 

In the process of creating **TL;DP**, I utilized the RAWG API to create my own tailored database of video games, implemented my own API endpoint following OPEN API specifications, conducted JUnit Testing, built out a clean and easy to use UI, and ultimately had a lot of fun.

If you're interested in checking out just the backend of the application or the Python work I did to create the database, feel free to explore my **TLDP-Core** and **TLDP-Database** repositories (respectively).

I'll also be adding a demo and overview of **TL;DP** to my YouTube channel.


## Features

- Additional Filtering: Tailor your search by platform, genre, and age to nail down the exact type of game you are looking for.
- Interactive Results: Explore the results of the search and click through each game to see an expanded title image as well as a description.
